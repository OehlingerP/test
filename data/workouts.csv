"Long Run - Knee safe","Run","Long run if your knee is not aggravated at all. Lets stay in touch this week to make sure we go into this confident that your knee isn't going to be pesky.","3","","2025-12-06","","28671.9296875","","",""," *06/12/2025 Peter Oehlinger: Used this run to get a reference for future runs. This route is perfect for simulating Val d’Aran. First two laps are on a shorter route but from lap 3 onwards one lap is 5.5km +315m vert which matches Val d’Aran perfectly. The goal would be to stay below 30min and be able to hold this pace for 20 laps. Still a long way to go but it’s always good to have a goal 😊 @Anna: we should probably talk about how I should run the long runs. This time I pushed on the first four laps so that my HR on the ascents was always close to 158bpm (I crossed it for just one second on the last push lap…). This feels quite hard and I needed to back off after the fourth lap. Fueling: 98g/hour + less the a liter of water. I am not thirsty when it’s cold. Knees: Yesterday I didn’t feel anything on both knees. This morning, however, the left knee acted up a bit. Interestingly, when I started to run the right knee acted up a bit and the left knee felt silent. Super strange. But both times it was only minor pain (max pain 2 out of 10). After 5 min of running both knees felt good. They were not acting up again during the run. On the first two laps I felt amazing. Then, when my muscles started to get tired, I was a bit uncomfortable because I thought the knee pain might come back but they felt good throughout the entire run. Let’s see how they feel in a couple of hours/tomorrow.* *06/12/2025 Anna DeMonte: Hey Peter! Great feedback and here are my recommendations: These long runs need to be mostly easy, with HR well below the ceiling so we don’t accumulate fatigue that worsens knee symptoms or compromises quality later in the block. I know you like to push things, but this weekend run in this block is not meant to be up tempo (close to Lt1). We will add in more intense, closer to LT1 efforts later in the block, but now is the time for these to be long, easy, and build your aerobic capacity.* *06/12/2025 Anna DeMonte: That Lt1 heart rate is not a goal, its an ""absolute ceiling"" or moreso a hard ""do not cross"" line. In terms of Val d'Aran, this is great that we're starting to think about it, but far far too early to start looking at the paces. Another way to think of this is, your two strength sessions are very important. If you're feeling fatigued going into the next lift, we know we've gone too hard in the long run.* *06/12/2025 Anna DeMonte: Your fueling is excellent. No adjustments needed now* *06/12/2025 Anna DeMonte: Lastly, as far as we are concerned, this run is great information for the knee. It's encouraging that your pain isn't increasing, but also reiterates why we really want to keep these nice and easy!*","2.92070126533508","2.72699999809265","","177","","141","159","","","0.650874224278157","140.8","82","78","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6","5"

Bad sleep, no fueling could be the reason but I was also sweating more heavily. Stopped early even if this means I am just short of 20 hours for the week. Legs are not particularly heavy after yesterday’s long run. Only my calfs are sore but this is still a result of the calf raises. My right knee acted up a little in the morning. So from this side I guess the downhill running might have been a bit too much. From next week on I’ll do the long runs at a lower HR.

The patella is a different story. I started to feel some pain 2-3/10 on the very last downhill. The good thing it appeared a bit later than last week but definitely something to watch. Ankle: was running on the trails and even though I need to be extra cautious right now I didn’t feel any pain. More time needed until it’s fully back to normal. Calfs: always a bit sore after Thursday. First signs of shin splints emerging. Maybe it would be good to include some preventative exercises given my history with shin splints.* *21/12/2025 Peter Oehlinger: Francesco Puppi did a very similar run (distance, elevation, HR) that same day.

"Peter: 160bpm 10% Incline Treadmill - HR Drift Test","Run","30 DEC 25 // 158 test // .06% drift // 10% incline @ 9.3km pace *The only way this test works is by not changing the treadmill speed once you have started your 1h5m, just start the test, get in the zone, and finish the whole 65 minutes at that speed* Heat is a massive issue during these tests, you must have a fan on you during this to stay as cool as possible (unless the room is super cold). TEST 0-10 minutes: 135-150 BPM 10-15 minutes: 151-162BPM 15-19 minutes: 162-166 BPM (push up above 162 slightly so we can get it to stabilize lower) 19-22: bring HR back down to 160. This is our stabilization period. You can start the timer once we get at least one min of stable 162bpm. 22-86 minutes: actual test period. don't change speed, let your HR move/drift. Once your HR stabilizes at 160bpm, DO NOT change the speed at ALL the entire test. We are tracking here how your HR drifts up, not how your speed changes. This is different than the track test. Full directions below. I want you to do this at 15% on the treadmill and target 160 BPM. Warmup, get your HR to stabilize at 160, and then start the test. Once your HR hits 160bpm the metabolic processes have more or less started, so I recommend warming up for the first 10 minutes under 150 BPM. IMPORTANT -Treadmills sometimes have time limits (like 60min) make sure you set the treadmill to something like 90 minutes or more -If treadmill only goes up to 60, I recommend restarting the workout on the treadmill after the warmup so it doesn't shut off in the test -Try and minimize the interruption so your test starts right at 160 BPM (or as close as possible). Let me know if you have any questions. Make sure not to adjust the speed or incline of the treadmill once the 60 minutes has started We want your HR to be stable at 160, so ideally look for values around 160 for a minute or two before you start the test. Once stabilized, run for 1:05 (hour and five min) at the exact same speed.","1.61666666666667","","2025-12-30","","14180","","",""," *30/12/2025 Peter Oehlinger: Treadmill AeT Test Incline: 10% Speed: 9.3km/h - 6:27min/km - 10:23min/mile Fueling: 45g before the run + 25g during warm up + 81g after the run Heat: no big issue. The combination of the treadmill fan and ice worked well. Thoughts: warm up was imo perfect. However, after pushing above 160, HR didn’t settle back to 160 within 3 min. I lowered the pace quite a bit (from 10.5km/h to 9km/h). HR dropped as I reduced the pace too much. I increased it to 9.3km/h for the test but should have increased it a bit more. Just didn’t want to adjust it 5min into the test and didn’t want to fail (i.e. reduce the pace again).* *30/12/2025 Peter Oehlinger: Add: my left calf is so sore and I don’t really understand why.

Actually, when we do these incline tests running, one of the first muscles to fatigue the most is calves as we raise the incline.

"Peter: Run Power Work (No Sled)","Strength","This isn't a conditioning workout, this is a power workout. Make sure you are completely rested between sets and not carrying much fatigue from exercise to exercise. Really focus on power output with each exercise. Eventually your power will start to fall off, pay attention to when this happens. After this point, the workout is of little effectiveness. Let me know how this sessions feels + how long it takes. Warmup 1) 10 min easy jog or bike 2) Dynamic drills: high knees, A-skips, bounding, hip openers 3) 2×30 m accelerations (gradually building speed) 4) 2×20 m skips for height + distance Plyometric Series 3 rounds total full recovery between rounds (2-3 min) 1) Single-Leg Hops (in place) 6-8/leg 2) Broad Jump 3×2 jumps 3) Bounding (alternating legs) 2×20 m https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3124L0KK3Q 4) Lateral Skater Jumps 2×6/side Strength-Speed Block Rest 2–3 min between sets 1) Single-Leg KB Swings 4×6/leg Light–moderate (16–24 kg) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGB1SwDHo3o 2) Explosive RDLs 4x4 (slow eccentric to mid shin, explosive concentric) 3) Trap Bar Deadlift Jumps 4x4 (Soft landing, 15-25% 1RM) 4) Vertical jump + stick 4 × 3 - Max vertical jump, soft landing, hold position 2–3 seconds -Do not chase fatigue or extra height with poor mechanics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gObPFKgofYE 5) Heavy kettlebell swings 3 × 6 Heavy but still fast, powerful hip extension If speed drops, stop the set https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2gXtvqLa_T8","1","","2026-01-01","","0","","",""," *01/01/2026 Peter Oehlinger: General thoughts: I like this workout a lot. Explosiveness has always been a big weakness for me. My jump height is a bit embarrassing 🙈 but I love to work on it 😊 At the end of the easy run following this workout I started to feel my legs. Plyometric Series Bounding is probably the most intense exercise in this series. In general no big issues. Feel the knee and ankle a bit but not pain. Strength-Speed Block 1) Single-Leg KB Swings 16kg with dumbbell. This is the most difficult exercise for me. I don’t really know what I should focus on. 2) Explosive RDLs 60kg 3) Trap Bar Deadlift Jumps 30kg 4) Vertical jump + stick Need to start on my toes. This feels so much better 5) Heavy kettlebell swings 20kg last set 24kg with dumbbell* *01/01/2026 Anna DeMonte: This is really good feedback, thank you for writing it out. On the explosiveness and jump height, i'd say this is definitely not to be embarrassed about! This is exactly why we are doing this.  Power is a trainable quality, especially as we haven't emphasized it yet. The goal for these early sessions is how cleanly and explosively you move.* *01/01/2026 Anna DeMonte: Feedback on your legs toward the end of the easy run afterward is also expected. This is really key here-> The power work is very neurologically and mechanically demanding, even though it does not feel like conditioning or a long run type of ""hard"". As long as that sensation clears by the next day and does not aggravate the knee or ankle, I'm happy with this! Let me know if you're feeling any of this tomorrow.* *01/01/2026 Anna DeMonte: For the plyos, bounding usually feels like the hardest piece, so that lines up in what I'd expect.. Lets go by this: light awareness in the knee and ankle is OK, but pain or increasing discomfort would not be. Keep me updated on this, again, our #1 goal throughout these entire blocks is to keep knees and ankles healthy to have quality long runs.*","1.36251640319824","0","","","","99","137","","","0.562738278029643","48.17","7","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4","5"

Probably due to skipping the run power workout this week. Not that this is a good thing, just an explanation. I felt the shins, the ankle and in the end also the knees BUT nothing more than feeling it a bit (pain 1/10). - I was a bit worried about the shins but it didn’t worsen over the run and at times fully disappeared. - The run was more demanding for the ankle because of running in the frozen snow. It needed to stabilize a lot and this is what I felt. This is a good thing. - For the knees I only felt the patella at the end a bit but also this was to be expected considering I did last weeks long run indoors and had no downhill stimulus. Overall everything is moving in the right direction. Fueling: 106g/h + <1l Sorry I forgot to do the glute activation before the run. Not that I don’t care I just didn’t check TP again and forgot about it.* *17/01/2026 Anna DeMonte: No worries on the glute activation. This is a good sign with the shins but something we need to be very very careful of moving forward. Tomorrow, if you start your run with strides and feel the shins, we need to move to stairmaster or pain free aeorbic for the whole day.
